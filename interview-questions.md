# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: 
  
  Git is the backbone software used for websites like Github in order for them to run as expected. In other words, git is used as the foundational technology behind sites like Github, that allow them to properly work. Github is a site for sharing and collaborating on various code related projects as well as a niche specific type "LinkedIn" for software developers to display their skillsets on previously completed projects for either future employers or fellow coding peers. 

  Researched answer:

  Git is an opensource software that optimizes source coding to active files during software development and can be a way for programmers to collaborate on various coding projects. Git is essentially a software management tool, where the mission is around source coding. This ties hand-in-hand with GitHub which is more or less a derivative hosting service that efficiently tracks the Git repositories through a user interface website maintained by a centeralize company (Microsoft) thus centeralizing such source code. As with any service provider, there are premium features avaiable for users who wish to pay to active them but there is a free-tier for the site servies. In other words, GitHub is a commericalized overlay service provider for the software Git and allows easier collaboration and visability to previous projects so potential employers can access one's skill-level.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: 

  Javascript operators allow a programer to define what particular output they are looking for in the context of what action or issue is needing to be resolved. So in order to receive a Boolean value back the individual would likely be dealing with numerical values. For instance in comparing is 2 a higher number than 4 or the other way around would show a Boolean value if inserted into the terminal.  

  Researched answer:

  Rational Operators, also known as Comparison Operators, will return a Boolean value. This occurs due the values being compared by a computer terminal are searching for the connection between such values. For example, if were looking for an output of whether 32 > 36, the output would return with a Boolean value of "false" because of course numerically speaking, 32 is not greater than 36. 


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: 

    An index can be seen has a collection list. This collection list is formed from individualized pieces known as values; they work in tandem display or organize data that can be later outputed depending upon the objective of the given developer. So indexes can be changed or updated by switching around values. 

  Researched answer:
   
    An index is basically a chronological ranking system for the characters in a string. So if I was using command terminal and input: 
    console.log("Not another assessment!" [7]), we'd get an output of "h" because when it concerns a string the letters or characters start at 0 and not the traditional 1; thus by counting from 0 to 7, the computer would land on the letter "h" or the 7th character using the provided index. A value can be descripted a number or a set of characters in a string that typically have a comparative relationship. In other words, if I was scripting code to layout parameters to ensure certain inputs would get specific outputs, I would write in key values and the relationship they have with one another to ensure the desired outputs are being produced. 



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: 

  It's a situation that is repeating itself time and time again. So for instance, if a developer was using command terminal and continuously getting the same output from the sequences they put in that, it could be said that's an iteration. 

  Researched answer:

  In the realm of Javascript, loops are used to allow programs to perform repetitive tasks. When performing such tasks the programm will go through cycles of this repeating process seen has designated loop cycles, more commonly referred to as loop iterations. Loop iterations are initiated by an iterator, typically the "for" in our line of code (as shown in the example below): 

  for (let i = 0; i < 77; i++) {
    console.log (i)
  }

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

  Proper pair programming consist of a driver and navigator. The driver is the one who is writing or executing the code; while the navigator is the one leading what is to be written/typed. Each one role should be respected and both parties should be paying attention to the other so that mistakes are found or avoid as much as possible. It also important to be respectful to the other individual(s) that one is working with as we can all learn from one another and have something to offer the process.

  Researched answer:

  Pair programming is practice of collaborating with one other person on programming tasks in conjoint-fashion. The process consist of a driver and a navigator. The driver is typing out the various lines of code, while the navigator is the one expressing or verbally guiding the driver on what to input next. Both parties however can and should contribute ideas for when troubleshooting occurs and maintain a sense of respect when sharing ideas, corrections, and general communication. These roles should be occassionally swapped so that all parties have experience with both roles. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: 

A function that gives an output of a function. Higher Order Functions are similiar to Rational or Comparative Operations in the sense that instead of returning a regular value, they output only Boolean values; just as Higher Orders Functions output only functions and not a completed task. 

2. Jest:

Jest is a Javascript software used for testing Javascript source code for efficiency. So in other words, when there are error or problems in the code Jest will help assist the programmer by giving them clues and semi-detailed context as why or where the issue may be occuring. 


3. Objects:

Objects are adaptable and can variety of things such as variables, functions, or data structures. So they can be used as the programmer sees fit depending upon the type of code sequence or program needing to be created. So they are similiar to chameleons in this sense. 

4. Method:

A method is a programmable instructions or standard operation procedures used to complete a task or list of task. The idea with using a method, when done correctly is to improve efficiency. 

5. Classes:

Classes are used to define how an object or group of objects is performing. They are used to categories active objects and can be revised within a program if something needs to be changed or updated.
